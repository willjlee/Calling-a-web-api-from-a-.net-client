Nots: Calling a WebAPI from a .NET client

http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/web-api-clients/calling-a-web-api-from-a-net-client


Note that the original tutorial targeted a different API than my solution. I used the contact manager API that I hosted online in the previous tutorial.

"The GetAsync method sends an HTTP GET request. As the name implies, GetAsyc is asynchronous. It returns immediately, without waiting for a response from the server. The return value is a Task object that represents the asynchronous operation. When the operation completes, the Task.Result property contains the HTTP response.

It is important to understand that taking the Result property blocks your application thread until the request completes (or times out)."

If you don't want JSON or XML, you can set your own data formatter. See the turorial for details, but you create a list of formatters to accept and then pass it as an argument to the ReadAsAsync method (which parses the response)

HttpClient methods of note:
getAsync, PostAsJsonAsync, PostAsXmlAsync, PutAsJsonAsync, PutAsXmlAsync, DeleteAsync

One can also treat error codes as exceptions using EnsureSuccessStatusCode() rather than IsSuccessfulStatusCode and then cacthing the exception.

HttpClient can be configured by creating a WebRequestHandler with desired options and passing it to the HttpClient constructor
